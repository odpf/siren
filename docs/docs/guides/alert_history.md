# Alert History Subscription

Siren can store the alerts triggered via Cortex Alertmanager. Cortex alertmanager is configured to call Siren API, using
a webhook receiver. This is done by adding a config in `config.yaml`

```yaml
siren_service:
  host: http://my.siren.io
```

Alert credentials create/update call makes sure alert history webhook is added in Cortex Alertmanager config. The
Alertmanager config would look like:

```yaml
receivers:
  - name: alert_history
    webhook_configs:
      - url: "http://my.siren.io/history"
```

After this, as soon as any alert is sent by Alertmanager to slack or pagerduty, it will be sent to Siren for storage
purpose.

To use this feature, you can configure your templates with proper annotations to identify:

- Which alert was triggered
- Which resource this alert refers to
- On Which metric, this alert was triggered
- What was the metric value for alert trigger
- What was the severity of alert(CRITICAL, WARNING or RESOLVED)

An Example template:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
type: template
name: CPU
body:
  - alert: CPUWarning
    expr: avg by (host) (cpu_usage_user{cpu="cpu-total"}) > [[.warning]]
    for: "[[.for]]"
    labels:
      severity: WARNING
    annotations:
      description: CPU has been above [[.warning]] for last [[.for]] {{ $labels.host }}
      resource: { { $labels.instance } }
      template: CPU
      metricName: cpu_usage_user
      metricValue: { { $labels.cpu_usage_user } }
  - alert: CPUCritical
    expr: avg by (host) (cpu_usage_user{cpu="cpu-total"}) > [[.critical]]
    for: "[[.for]]"
    labels:
      severity: CRITICAL
    annotations:
      description: CPU has been above [[.critical]] for last [[.for]] {{ $labels.host }}
      resource: { { $labels.instance } }
      template: CPU
      metricName: cpu_usage_user
      metricValue: { { $labels.cpu_usage_user } }
variables:
  - name: for
    type: string
    default: 10m
    description: For eg 5m, 2h; Golang duration format
  - name: warning
    type: int
    default: 80
  - name: critical
    type: int
    default: 90
tags:
  - systems
```

Please note that, the mandatory keys, in order to successfully store Alert History is,

```yaml
labels:
  severity: CRITICAL
annotations:
  resource: { { $labels.instance } }
  template: CPU
  metricName: cpu_usage_user
  metricValue: { { $labels.cpu_usage_user } }
```

The keys are pretty obvious to match with what was described in bullets points in the introduction above.

In the above example we can see, the alert annotation has sufficient values for alert history storage. We can set up
cortex alertmanager, to call Siren AlertHistory APIs as a webhook receiver. The above annotations and labels will be
parsed by Siren APIs, to be stored in the database.

**Alert History Creation via API**

```text
POST /history HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 357

{
    "alerts": [
        {
            "status": "firing",
            "labels": {
                "severity": "CRITICAL"
            },
            "annotations": {
                "resource": "apolloVM",
                "template": "CPU",
                "metricName": "cpu_usage_user",
                "metricValue": "90"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The request body of Alertmanager POST call to configured webhook looks something like (after you have followed the
labels and annotations c in the templates) above snippet.

Siren POST `/history` API will parse the above payload and store in the database, which you can fetch via the GET APIs
with proper filters of startTime, endTime. See the [swagger](../../api/handlers/swagger.yaml) file for more details.
